When I was in middle school, my nickname was "sasquatch." "Squatch" for short. While never officially confirmed by the lovely boys of my middle school class, it was undoubtedly a reference to my thick eyebrows, dark hair, and tan skin. I am certainly not the first person to write about what it's like to be a middle school girl, to look back on those years and cringe so violently that I have to physcially change my current position. "Everyone goes through their awkward phase, it's just part of growing up," is what we are so often told. The one thing I was never told, however, was that I was being called these names because I wasn't white, and I never was! 

Growing up in a town like Armonk, New York, a town that is described by google as "pituresuqe" and boasts an "upscale lifestyle," I'd feel pretty pretentious to sit here and say that it sucked. But when I look back on my childhood from the perspective of a 20-something-year-old post-liberal arts college graduate, I cant help but feel a mix of profound negativity.
